# Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm Senja and my pronouns are she/hers.

# Work and development 👩🏼‍💻

Currently, I am senior front end developer at [Brella](https://www.brella.io/).

I love anything and everything [front of the front end](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/): styles (CSS and any of its pre-processors), animations, microinteractions and transitions. I'm very interested in design systems and I am studying accessibility.

I write a [blog at Dev.to](https://dev.to/sjarva).

# Hobbies

I do a lot of handicrafts. Mostly knitting and sewing, but I dabble also in embroidery, weaving and felting.

Talking of felting: I don't have any pets, expect for this felted Octocat.

Yes, I made this, isn't it adorable?!
